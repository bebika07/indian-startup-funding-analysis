# Startup Funding Analysis

This project analyzes startup funding data from a CSV file (`startup_funding.csv`), cleans and preprocesses it, performs exploratory data analysis, and visualizes key insights using Python.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

* **Data Loading**
  Reads startup funding data from a CSV file.

* **Data Cleaning**

  * Standardizes column names.
  * Parses and cleans date values.
  * Handles missing values.
  * Cleans funding amount formats.
  * Removes duplicate rows.

* **Analysis**

  * Identifies top 10 startups by funding.
  * Identifies top 10 industries by funding.
  * Tracks funding trends over time.

* **Visualizations**

  * Funding trend over time (line chart).
  * Top 10 startups by funding (bar chart).
  * Top 10 industries by funding (bar chart).

## ðŸ›  Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

```
Main.py               # Main script for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization
startup_funding.csv   # Dataset file (not included; provide your own)
```

## ðŸš€ Usage

1. **Place your dataset** in the same directory as `Main.py` and name it `startup_funding.csv`.
2. **Run the script**:

   ```bash
   python Main.py
   ```
3. The script will:

   * Print cleaned dataset previews.
   * Display calculated statistics.
   * Show visualizations.

## ðŸ–¼ Example Outputs

* Funding trend over time (line graph).
* Top funded startups (bar chart).
* Top funded industries (bar chart).


If you want, I can also **add sample images of the visualizations** to this README so it looks more professional and appealing. Would you like me to do that?
